Synergy is an extensible general purpose management service to be integrated in OpenStack. Its capabilities are implemented by a collection of managers which are specific and independent pluggable tasks, executed periodically, like the cron jobs, or interactively through a RESTful API. Different managers can coexist and they can interact with each other in a loosely coupled way by implementing any even complex business logic (figure 1).
