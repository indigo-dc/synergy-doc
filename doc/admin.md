# Installation and configuration using puppet

We provide a Puppet module for Synergy so users can install and configure Synergy with Puppet.
The module provides both the `synergy-service` and `synergy-scheduler-manager` components.

The module is available on the [Puppet Forge](https://forge.puppet.com/) : [vll/synergy](https://forge.puppet.com/vll/synergy/readme).

Install the puppet module with:
```
puppet module install vll-synergy
```

Usage example:
```puppet
class { 'synergy':
  synergy_db_url          => 'mysql://test:test@localhost',
  dynamic_quotas          => {'project_A' => 1,  'project_B' => 2},
  project_shares          => {'project_A' => 70, 'project_B' => 30 },
  user_shares             => {'project_A' => {'user1' => 60, 'user2' => 40 },
                              'project_B' => {'user3' => 80, 'user4' => 20}},
  keystone_url            => 'https://example.com',
  keystone_admin_user     => 'admin',
  keystone_admin_password => 'the admin password',
}
```

# The Synergy command line interface

The Synergy service provides a command-line client, called **synergycli**, which allows the Cloud administrator to monitor and control the Synergy service.

Before running the synergycli client command, you must create and source the *admin-openrc.sh* file to set the relevant environment variables. This is the same script used to run the OpenStack command line tools. 

Note that the OS_AUTH_URL variables must refer to the v3 version of the keystone API, e.g.:

```export OS_AUTH_URL=https://cloud-areapd.pd.infn.it:35357/v3```

### synergycli list                

This command returns the list of managers that have been deployed in the synergy service.

E.g.:

```
$ synergycli list
--------------------
| manager          |
--------------------
| QuotaManager     |
| FairShareManager |
| QueueManager     |
--------------------
```




### synergycli start               

This command starts the managers deployed in the synergy service.

E.g.:

```
$ synergycli start
-----------------------------------------------------
| manager          | status  | message              |
-----------------------------------------------------
| QuotaManager     | RUNNING | started successfully |
| FairShareManager | RUNNING | started successfully |
| QueueManager     | RUNNING | started successfully |
```



### synergycli stop                

This command stops the managers deployed in the synergy service.

E.g.:

```
$ synergycli stop
----------------------------------------------------
| manager          | status | message              |
----------------------------------------------------
| QuotaManager     | ACTIVE | stopped successfully |
| FairShareManager | ACTIVE | stopped successfully |
| QueueManager     | ACTIVE | stopped successfully |
----------------------------------------------------
```



### synergycli status              

This command returns the status of the managers deployed in the synergy service. 

E.g.:

```
$ synergycli status
------------------------------
| manager          | status  |
------------------------------
| QuotaManager     | RUNNING |
| FairShareManager | RUNNING |
| QueueManager     | RUNNING |
------------------------------
```



### synergycli get_quota           

This command, for each dynamic project, shows the resources being used wrt the total number of dynamic resources.

In the following example:

* *limit=15.0* for *vcpus* for each dynamic project says that the total number of VCPUs for the dynamic portion of the resources is 15. This is calculated considering the total number of resources and the ones allocated to static projects. The overcommitment factor is also taken into account.
* limit=17512.0 for *memory* for each dynamic project says that the total number of MB of RAM for the dynamic portion of the resources is 17512. This is calculated considering the total number of resources and the ones allocated to static projects. The overcommitment factor is also taken into account.
* *prj_a* is currently using 5 VCPUs and 2560 MB of RAM
* *prj_a* is currently using 10 VCPUs and 5120 MB of RAM
* the total number of VCPUs currently used by the dynamic projects is 15 (the value reported between parenthesis)
* the total number of MB of RAM currently used by the dynamic projects is 7680 (the value reported between parenthesis)


```
$ synergycli get_quota
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| project | vcpus                       | memory                             |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| prj_b   | in use=10 (15) | limit=15.0 | in use=5120 (7680) | limit=17512.0 |
| prj_a   | in use=5 (15)  | limit=15.0 | in use=2560 (7680) | limit=17512.0 |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```




### synergycli get_priority        

This command returns the priority set in that moment by Synergy to all users of the dynamic projects, to guarantee the fair share use of the resources (considering the policies specified  by the Cloud administrator and considering the past usage of such resources).

E.g. in the following example *user_a2* of project *prj_a* has the highest priority:

```
$ synergycli get_priority
--------------------------------
| project | user    | priority |
--------------------------------
| prj_b   | user_b2 | 20       |
| prj_b   | user_b1 | 4        |
| prj_a   | user_a2 | 72       |
| prj_a   | user_a1 | 52       |
--------------------------------
```



### synergycli get_share           

This command reports the shares imposed by the Cloud administrator (attribute *shares* in the synergy configuration file) to the dynamic projects and to their users.

E.g. in the following example *prj_a* was given 70 % of the share, and the rest (30 %) was given to *prj_b*. 

The relevant users of these 2 projects were given the same share. 

Therefore the 2 users of *prj_a* has each one a share of 50 % within the project, and a share of 35 % (50 % of 70 %) of total resources.

The 2 users of *prj_b* has each one a share of 50 % within the project, and a share of 15 % (50 % of 30 %) of total resources.


```
$ synergycli get_share
------------------------------------------------
| project | share | user    | user share (abs) |
------------------------------------------------
| prj_b   | 30.0% | user_b2 | 50.00% (15.00%)  |
| prj_b   | 30.0% | user_b1 | 50.00% (15.00%)  |
| prj_a   | 70.0% | user_a2 | 50.00% (35.00%)  |
| prj_a   | 70.0% | user_a1 | 50.00% (35.00%)  |
------------------------------------------------
```




### synergycli get_usage           

```
$ synergycli get_usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| project | cores usage | ram usage | user    | cores usage (abs) | ram usage (abs)  |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| prj_b   | 68.74%      | 68.74%    | user_b2 | 0.00% (0.00%)     | 0.00% (0.00%)    |
| prj_b   | 68.74%      | 68.74%    | user_b1 | 100.00% (68.74%)  | 100.00% (68.74%) |
| prj_a   | 31.26%      | 31.26%    | user_a2 | 0.00% (0.00%)     | 0.00% (0.00%)    |
| prj_a   | 31.26%      | 31.26%    | user_a1 | 100.00% (31.26%)  | 100.00% (31.26%) |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

retrieve the resource usage


### synergycli get_queue   

This command returns the number of queued requests (i.e. requests in scheduling state, waiting for available resources) for each static project and for the dynamic projects, in total.

E.g. in the following example there are no pending requests for the 2 static projects (admin and service), while there are 70 queued requests in total for the dynamic projects.

```
$ synergycli get_queue
---------------------------
| name    | status | size |
---------------------------
| admin   | ON     | 0    |
| dynamic | ON     | 70   |
| service | ON     | 0    |
---------------------------
```
